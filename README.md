# Capstone Project - Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my capstone project for the Data Science course.  
The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning methods can be applied to predict stock market movements.  
By combining finance knowledge with data science tools, I aim to evaluate whether simple models (linear regression, decision trees, etc.) can provide meaningful predictions of stock returns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and preprocess stock market data (Yahoo Finance / Kaggle).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends.  
- Implement different supervised learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Classification models (Decision Trees, kNN, Naive Bayes)
  - Simple Neural Network (optional, for comparison)
- Compare model performance and interpret results.  
- Discuss limitations and possible improvements.
